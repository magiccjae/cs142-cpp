I have 4 brothers. We meet everyday online in the game called Lol.
sometimes mom calls one of us and she can talk to all of us at the same time.
I went to Cafe Rio today for dinner and it was good. I was so hungry at that time, 
because I hadn't eaten anything. I'm so looking forward playing soccer this saturday 
with my friends. Great weather is expected for this weekend.
